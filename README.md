# My own azure resume, following ACG.

## First steps

- Adjusted frontend, HTML contains my CV and details
- main.js contains visitor counter code.
- Strugled with properly git push some data into github. Need to be carefull what folder i am pushing. Fortunately i could 
git revert <commit_hash>

- Strugled with deploying function app to azure: First i found out i needed to create a Storage Account. Later found after some reaserch that I was missed a lot of things not being attached to my subscription.
such as
--namespace Microsoft.Web, Microsoft.Storage, Microsoft.Insights, Microsoft.Network, Microsoft.ManagedIdentity
